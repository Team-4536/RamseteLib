# RamseteLib
probably won't be needed after january but yay

Now how do I obtain this in my code?
Well first of all, I hope you use gradle.
Add this line into your build.gradle file in your repositories{...}
```
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

then add this in your dependencies{...}
```
implementation 'com.github.Team-4536:RamseteLib:1.0'
```

import and you're done!
